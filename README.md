# Network-Emulator
This project involves configuring a network topology with multiple blocks, implementing routing protocols (EIGRP, OSPF, and RIP) in different blocks, using VLSM for IP addressing, setting up NAT on Router, and implementing access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to specific servers from certain networks.
